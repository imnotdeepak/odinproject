        <p>Chicken tenders? Yes please! An old tried and true American classic is coming to plates near you! All you need is some chicken, seasoning, flour, and milk, and you can have your very own chicken tenders!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the marinade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds of chicken tenderloins</li>
            <li>1 cup of buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoons of cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoons of garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoons of paprika</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the breading</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
            <li>1 heaping teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoons of black pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoons of garlic powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoons of paprika</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of buttermilk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For cooking</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3-4 cups of vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Take the chicken and all of the seasonings listed for the marinade and put them in a big plastic bag. Mix everything together so the chicken is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Put it in a bowl and store it in the refridgerator for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>When you're ready to cook them, make the breading: In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika.</li>
            <li>Whisk until well blended.</li>
            <li>Add the buttermilk and stir with a fork until the mixture is evenly clumpy.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken tenders from the marinade a few at a time and toss into the breading mixture.</li>
            <li>Be sure to press the chicken firmly into the breading so clumps adhere to the meat. (It’s a messy job: use one hand to remove the wet tenders from the bag and the other to toss in the breading.)</li>
            <li>Set breaded tenders on a foil-lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>To fry the chicken: Line a baking sheet with a few layers of paper towels and set next to the stove. Add oil to a large, high-sided pot until the level reaches about 3/4-inch. Heat over medium-high heat until oil is shimmering (about 350°). (If a cube of bread sizzles when you drop it in, it’s ready.) Using tongs, place several chicken tenders in the hot oil without crowding the pan. Cook until golden brown on the bottom side, a few minutes, then flip and cook until the second side is also golden, a few minutes more.</li>
            <li>Set the cooked tenders on the paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain.</li>
            <li>Fry remaining tenders in batches adjusting the heat as necessary (if the tenders are browning too fast, lower the heat)</li>
