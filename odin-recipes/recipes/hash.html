        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Potatoes, eggs, cheese, and bacon, all in one pan! Who could say no to something like that on a weekend morning!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 strips of raw bacon</li>
            <li>1 lb Yukon gold potatoes</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>½ red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>½ green bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>¼ cup cheddar cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil for extra drizzling</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro roughly chopped, thinly sliced chives for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400˚F. Place strips of bacon in a large (at least 10 inch), oven safe skillet. Cook over medium low heat on both sides until cooked through but not yet crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat to a paper towel lined plate and set aside, leaving the bacon grease in the pan. When the bacon is cool enough to handle, roughly dice.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium high, add the potatoes, bell pepper, and onion and cook for 7- 8 minutes, stirring frequently, until starting to soften and can be pierced with a fork</li>
            <li>Add garlic, cumin, chili powder, paprika, black pepper, and salt. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until garlic is fragrant.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon, create 4 to 6 holes (depending on how many eggs you want) in the hash mixture for the eggs. Distribute the cheeses evenly into each hole, and then crack one egg into each hole.</li>
            <li>Place in the preheat oven and cook for 5-10 minutes, until egg white is set but the yolk is still runny.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Sprinkle with cooked bacon. Garnish with fresh ground black pepper, cilantro and chives.</li>
        </ol>
